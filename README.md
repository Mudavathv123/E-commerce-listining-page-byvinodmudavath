# E-commerce Listining Page
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

You are tasked with building the UI for an E-commerce Listing Page based
on the provided Figma design. The page should display a list of products, and
each product should have an option to either view the product or add it to the
cart. There will be no dedicated product page, so when a user clicks "View
Product," they should be redirected to a custom Thank You page.
Additionally, when users click "Add to Cart," a modal should open, as per ui
design.


React-based UI that adheres to the following structure and features:
1. Header Section:a. A search bar for searching products.
b. Icons for profile and cart.

2. Product List Section:
a. Display a grid/list of products based on design.

b. Each product card should include:

i. Product Image

ii. Product Name

iii. Price

iv. "View Product" and "Add to Cart" buttons.

c. Clicking "View Product" should redirect the user to a custom
"Thank You" page. There will be no product details page, so you
are required to design a Thank You page from scratch.

3. Add to Cart Modal:
a. Clicking “Add to Cart” on any product should open a modal that
displays the product’s details and an option to confirm adding the
product to the cart.
b. The modal design is included in the Figma file and should be
closely followed.

4. Pagination:
a. Implement pagination to navigate through multiple product
listings (functional but mock data is acceptable).

5. Thank You Page:
a. Create a simple "Thank You" page to which users are redirected
after clicking "View Product". This page should acknowledge their
action with a simple message (e.g., "Thank you for your interest in
[Product Name]!").
Technical Requirements:
1. ReactJS:
a. Use React for building the application with a component-based
architecture.

b. Structure the code with a focus on clean architecture and
componentization.

2. Componentization:
a. Break down the app into reusable components such as
ProductCard, Header, Pagination, and AddToCartModal.

b. Make sure each component handles a specific functionality.

3. Routing:
a. Use React Router to manage navigation between the product
listing page and the Thank You page.

4. State Management:
a. Utilize React hooks or context API for managing state,
particularly for pagination, modals, and product actions.

5. Mock Data:
a. Use static or mock data for products (I'm don't need to
implement a backend or API).

6. Modal Implementation:
a. The "Add to Cart" button should trigger a modal displaying the
product’s details and a confirmation button to add the product to
the cart.
